Intent: This website used for booking concerts tickets. Guest users can create their own account to buy tickets for new concerts and/or see the information of concerts that they have registered.

Progress:

1) Three models are created, namely Concert, User and Purchase.

2) Three RESTful resources, each with seven routes corresponding to a model above. This may be further updated later.

3) The login/logout function (user authentication and user authorization) have not been implemented and some functions will be added in final project.
